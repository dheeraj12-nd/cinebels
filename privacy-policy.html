            <h2>
              <span>This privacy policy (hereafter the "Policy") primarily describes:</span>
            </h2>
            <p>The information that CPL collects through the Website <a href="https://www.cinebels.com/" target="_blank">(www.cinebels.com),</a> which is hosted and operated from India; the use and role of cookies and similar technologies on the Website <a href="https://www.cinebels.com/" target="_blank">(www.cinebels.com);</a> and the security measures CPL has in place to protect the information that CPL gathers through the Website <a href="https://www.cinebels.com/" target="_blank">(www.cinebels.com).</a> </p>

            <h2>
              <span>1. Information Gathered by CPL through the Website</span>
            </h2>
            <p>CPL gathers two basic types of information through the Website: (i) "Personal Information," information from which an individual can be identified, and (ii) "Aggregate Information," from which an individual cannot be identified.</p>
            <ul class="list-style-alpha">
              <li>Personal Information. You are not ordinarily required to register or provide Personal Information in order to access the Website. However, certain functionalities such as a membership program, through which purchasers of products may receive discounts on online purchases, participate in any contests, etc., may require registration. CPL collects Personal Information from you only when you voluntarily provide it to CPL - for example, in contacting CPL through the Website, answering surveys and polls, entering contests and similar promotions, signing up for email/SMS updates and announcements concerning the CPL's products and special promotions, and purchasing the CPL’s merchandise. Personal Information may include your contact information (such as your name, postal address, telephone number, and/or email address), as well as your payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date ("Payment Information"), which will be collected as part of the purchase transaction of any product or merchandise made available through the Website ("Transaction").</li>
              <li>Aggregate Information. When you visit the Website, CPL and the third parties with whom the CPL has contracted to provide services may collect anonymous information from three sources: server log files, cookies, and pixel tags. <ul class="list-style-number">
                  <li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in the CPL’s server log files whenever you visit the Website, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. IP addresses of all Visitors are used by the CPL to calculate the Website usage levels, to help diagnose problems with the Website's servers, and to administer the Website. CPL may also use IP addresses to communicate or to block access to Visitors who fail to comply with the Policy and/or the Terms and Conditions of Use of the Website. Collecting IP addresses is a standard practice followed on the Internet and is carried out automatically by many websites.</li>
                  <li>This website uses cookies. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites and help facilitate users' on-going access to and use of a particular website. Cookies do not cause damage to the computer system or files, and only the website that transfers a particular cookie to the computer system can read, modify, or delete such cookie. If you do not want your information to be collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure to be followed, in most browsers that allows the user that allows the user to delete existing cookies, automatically decline cookies, or be be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of particular cookies to the user's computer system. You should note, however, that declining cookies may make it difficult or impossible for you to access certain portions of the Website.</li>
                  <li>This website uses "Pixel Tags". The Website may use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") to compile aggregate statistics about Website usage and response rates. Pixel Tags enable CPL to maintain a count of the users who have visited certain pages of the Website. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the email was opened and read by the receiver of the e-mail.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
              <span>2. Use and Disclosure of Information Gathered By CPL through the Website</span>
            </h2>
            <ul class="list-style-alpha">
              <li>Personal Information. CPL may use Visitor's Personal Information in any of the following ways: <ul class="list-style-number">
                  <li>CPL encourages the Visitors to contact CPL with questions and comments. Personal Information may be used by CPL in order to respond to the respective Visitor's questions and comments.</li>
                  <li>CPL may also use the Personal Information of its Visitors for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing its businesses. The Personal Information collected from the Website may be combined with other information collected by CPL via other online or offline sources, with demographic information and other information that is available in the public domain.</li>
                  <li>When you take part in a Transaction through the Website such as purchasing products or merchandise, CPL may collect Payment Information from you related to such Transaction as well as other Personal Information such as shipping address for shipping of the ordered products or merchandise purchased through the Website. CPL may use your Personal Information or Payment Information in order to complete the Transaction and, if applicable, to fulfill your purchase. The Payment Information may also be shared with third parties, as may be necessary, to complete your Transaction (for example, to process the payment made through the credit card).
</li>
                  <li>From time to time, contests, competitions, and similar promotions may be organized through its Website that may require online registration by the Visitor to participate in such contest, competition, or promotion (which may include name, email, user ID, and password). CPL may ask you for certain Personal Information during the registration process for participating in such contests, competitions, or promotional schemes. CPL may share this Personal Information with third-party sponsors of such contests, competitions, and promotions (irrespective of whether it is hosted by CPL), in accordance with the rules applicable to such contest, competition, or promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each contest, competition, and promotion in which you participate through the Website, as they may contain certain additional important information about CPL or a sponsor's use of your Personal Information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your Personal Information enlarge the scope of use of such information in terms of this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall also apply.</li>
                  <li>In addition, CPL reserves the right to use your Personal Information for sending you e-mails of updates and announcements concerning CPL's products and special promotions. You may opt out of receiving these messages from CPL at any time.</li>
                  <li>CPL may from time to time and as may be necessary use your Personal Information to send emails consisting of important information regarding the Website, your Transactions, or for notifying any amendments or modifications to the terms, conditions, and policies of CPL with respect to use of this Website ("Critical Emails"). Since Critical Emails would consist of important information you shall not have the option of not receiving Critical Emails.</li>
                  <li>CPL works with third parties who provide services, including website hosting, credit card processing, data analysis, newsletter services, promotional activities, logistics services, and other administrative services. CPL may share your Personal Information, including your Payment Information, with such third parties, as may be necessary, for the purpose of enabling such third parties to discharge the provision of such services. Your Personal Information may also be shared with the brand /manufacturer/supplier/marketer of the products ordered/purchased by you on the Website or with entities responsible for delivering the products ordered/purchased by you on the Website in order to measure and analyze the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and website functioning and for other bonafide purpose as we may desire. Your Personal Information may also be used by the brand for marketing and promotional purposes. You may opt out of receiving such communication from the brand at any time by clicking on the Unsubscribe feature in the email received by you. By usage of our Website, you expressly permit CPL to access such information for one or more purposes deemed fit by CPL.</li>
                  <li>CPL may disclose your Personal Information if CPL believes that it is required to do so: (i) by law; (ii) to comply with legal process or governmental requests; (iii) to enforce the Terms and Conditions of Use; (iv) to protect our operations; (v) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of CPL, you or others; and (vi) to enable itself to pursue the available remedies or limit the damages that it may sustain.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Aggregate Information. CPL may analyze Aggregate Information in order to enhance the Website security, track the popularity of certain pages of the Website, track the success of our email notifications, assess traffic levels on the Website and other usage data, all of which would help CPL to provide content tailored to the interests of the consumers, improve the Website and related services and to otherwise enhance Visitor’s experience on the Website. CPL may also share the Aggregate Information with its Other Entities and other third parties for the provision of such services or for the completion of your Transactions on the Website.</li>

              <span>3. Other Important Notes Regarding CPL's Privacy Practices</span>
            </h2>
            <ul class="list-style-alpha">
              <li>The Website and the contents therein are intended for a general audience and not intended for utilization directly or independently by children under 18 years of age. If you are a child under the age of 18 years and desire to use this Website or purchase any products or merchandise ( being sold through this Website), please request your parents or guardians to complete the necessary registration formalities and complete the Transaction. Any use of this Website or any of its features by a child under the age of 18 years must be under parental supervision. CPL does not directly contact children under the age of 18 years for promotion of its special offers or for marketing purposes. CPL also does not knowingly collect Personal Information from any child under the age of 18 years.</li>
              <li>CPL has adequate security measures and tools in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under CPL's control. Whenever any Visitor furnishes his/her credit card number, that credit card number is transmitted by the Visitor's browser in an encrypted format using an industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption method. Even though CPL endeavors to protect its Visitor’s Personal Information, CPL cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to CPL, through or in connection with the website. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with CPL is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with CPL has been compromised), you must immediately notify CPL of the problem by contacting us in accordance with "Contact Us," below (note that physical mail notification will delay the time it takes for CPL to address and respond to the problem).</li>
              <li>The Website may contain links to third-party websites. These linked sites (including the websites of CPL's Other Entities) are not under the control and supervision of CPL and CPL shall in no way be responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such third-party linked websites, or any information contained in any linked websites. CPL provides such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Website does not imply endorsement of the linked website by CPL. If you furnish your Payment Information or other Personal Information through any such third party website, your transaction will occur on such third party's website (and not on this Website) and the Personal Information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. It is important that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties, before furnishing any Personal Information or Payment Information on their websites.</li>
              <li>CPL reserves the right to transfer any and all information that it collects from the Visitors to a third party in the event of any merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of CPL's assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>

            <h2>
              <span>5. From time to time, CPL may ask you to indicate whether you are interested in receiving emails and other information from CPL or not. If you elect to receive these communications, CPL will occasionally send you emails/SMS or other information that matches your requests and offer you promotions and coupons.</span>
            </h2>
            <p>If at any time you wish to stop receiving these email/SMS communications from CPL, you may put up a request for discontinuation of sending such e-mails by emailing, calling, or writing to CPL using the contact information provided on the Website or by using the unsubscribe feature in the email received by you.

            <p>In addition, CPL does not disclose your Personal Information to third parties, including CPL's subsidiaries and the holding companies, for third-party's direct marketing purposes if CPL has received and processed a request from you that your Personal Information should not be shared with third parties for such purposes. If you would like to submit such a request, you may do so by emailing, calling, or writing to CPL using the contact information provided above. Please indicate that you request that CPL should not disclose your Personal Information to its subsidiaries and/or other third parties for direct marketing purposes.</p>
